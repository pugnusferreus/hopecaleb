    Pastor Peter McHugh spoke on the 13th of August 2011 during our Hope Bible Conference 2011. 
    He is the senior pastor of C3 Whitehorse Church. 
    Peter is courageous, tenacious, open and honest and profoundly in love with the Lord.  
    He lives and preaches an authentic kingdom lifestyle that demolishes religion and replaces it with the joy of bringing heaven to earth.

  <p>
    He wrote two interesting books that I encourage my fellow brothers and sisters to read.
    <ul>
      <li>A Voyage Of Mercy</li>
      <li>Above The Line</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>
    The following are some points that I've recorded during his preaching on 13th August 2011.
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>By living a Christian life, only can you enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</li>
    <li>Heaven invades through all of us. It is our duty to set an outpost of Heaven here on Earth.</li>
    <li>Jesus came as a Mesiah to go against the enemy of mankind; The devil.</li>
    <li>We, as Christians are here to multiply bread and fish, to open blind eyes and to save. See John 14:12 and John 2:1-12</li>
    <li>Christian life is about spreading the Kingdom of God through you.</li>
    <li>When you're angry it is caused by your mind. Whatever you do is an echo of your believe.</li>
    <li>Rules can never change a person's behaviour.</li>
    <li>If you do not believe that what Jesus did will save us, our behaviour will never change.</li>
    <li>Paul's letter always start with something theological and ends with how we should live our lives.</li>
    <li>Right Believing is equals to Right Living.</li>
    <li>Don't change your theology base upon your experience. Don't get discourage when your prayer doesn't heal.</li>
    <li>Behaviour is an echo to what you blieve.</li>
    <li>God is not interested in what is wrong but what is missing.</li>
    <li>Being a Christian is not about your performance but in believing right.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>
    Pastor Peter McHugh speaks about the three covenant as well.
  </h2>
  <h2>Abrahamic Covenant</h2>
  <p>
    We are all Abraham's descendants, thus we're all living and under God's covenant. See Genesis 12:10-20.
    Even when Abraham did not listen to God's words, with God's grace, he protected him from the Pharaoh.
  </p>
  <h2>Mosaic Covenant</h2>
  <p>
    We behave and perform right (see Exodus 24:3-10)
  </p>
  * Didn't note down the 3rd Covenant. Will add it in.

  I hope that these notes will be useful to those who have missed Pastor Peter McHugh's preaching and also a reminder for the rest of us.
