    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1. What is God’s designation of himself at the beginning of this chapter? Why does this seem especially appropriate considering the chapter’s contents?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God's designation of himself was "God Almighty". It is appropriate because he is the provider, the nurturer and he controls destiny.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2. How long was it since God last spoke to Abram? During these years, how do you think Abram may have felt? (James 1:2-4)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    13 years. He probably felt abandoned. In our daily life, sometimes we feel that we're in a box.
    We won't know what God have in store for us. We need to be patient and when we get our reward from God, we'll appreciate his gift.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3. What did God command Abram to do in verse 1? Do you think Abram is able to obey that command? Do you think we are able to obey that command?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God wants Abram to walk before him faithfully and be blameless. What God meant by "walk" is to have a relationship with him consistantly.
    We'll be able to obey that command if we believe that Jesus is our Saviour. Then we'll have that everlasting relationship with God.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4. God’s declaration of his covenant with Abram from verse 4-8. Expand on the following words within the verses and their significance
    <ul>
      <li>a. "covenant"</li>
      <li>b. "nations"</li>
      <li>c. "everlasting"</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p><b>Covenant</b> means a two way promise. A promise from God, and also a promise from us to God. God always fulfill his promise.</p>
    <p><b>Nations</b> means people from all over the world.</p>
    <p><b>Everlasting</b> means forever. Our life is finite. When God says forever, the promise goes to our descendants as well.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    5. Every time God made a covenant with Abram he begins with "I will", which shows that he will keep his word his promises. Do you think "words" or "promises" are worth much today?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Words and promises aren't worth much today. The human nature itself doesn't honour words and promises.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    6. Do you think you are a person that is good at keeping your word?
  </div>

    Open Question
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    7. What was the purpose of changing the names of Abram and Sarai? How would it have been significant?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    As a sign of reborn, change of identity. It is significant because it is a metamorphosis from what they were to what they will become.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    8. According to verses 9-14, what was Abram’s responsibility? Why do you think this act is significant?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Abram's responsibility is to circumcise every male in his household including himself. 
    Circumcision means cutting himselft from the world.
    Circumcision is done on the male reproductive organ because it represents intimacy and is hidden.
  </div>
    <div class="question">
    9. Why do you think Abram laughed to himself in verse 17?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    He has doubt. He questioned God because he is already 100 years old and Sarah is already 90 years old.
