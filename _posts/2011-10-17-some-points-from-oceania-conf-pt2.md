    Questions to ponder:
  </h2>
  <h2>
    In what ways are you presently walking above the line and how would you like to grow?
  </h2>
  <p>
    <b>Intimacy</b>,<b>Identity</b>,<b>Influence</b>,<b>Inheritence</b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We should not punish each other for each other's sin. Jesus has already died for our sins.</li>
    <li>Ask yourself, we already have Kings of Kings in us and why do we need to punish each other? John  5:19</li>
    <li>Devil hates peace and rest</li>
    <li>When you have fear in life, you won't have the revelations of love from God. Ephesians 3:10</li>
    <li>Worship is experiencing God.</li>
    <li>Jesus revealed to mankind that God is a father and not a judge.</li>
    <li>God wants to help you to stop sinning and not to judge you. 2 Corinthians 5:19</li>
    <li>If you're ashamed of yourself, this means that you think that Jesus died on the cross for your sins are not good enough for you.</li>
    <li>Keep walking, every attempt is a success.</li>
    <li>Jesus being crucified on the cross is an inheritence to us.</li>
  </ul>
