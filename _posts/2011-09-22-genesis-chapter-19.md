    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    Two angels arrived at Sodom while Lot was sitting in the gateway. Lot recognize them straight away and asked them to spend a night at his house.
    The angels declined but Lot insisted and so they stayed at Lot's home.
    When the people of Sodom knew that there are two strangers living in Lot's house, the Sodomites surrounded the house and demand
    Lot to hand over the 2 Angels so that they can have sex with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lot told them not to do such wicked things and willing to give them his two daughters instead.
    They put pressure on Lot and moved forward to break the door.
    The men pulled Lot back inside and struck the Sodomites with blindness so that they could not find the door.
  </p>
  <p>
    The angels told Lot to flea Sodom. Of course, Lot told his family. His son in law laughed at him and stayed back.
    He escaped with his wife and his 2 daughters. The angels told Lot not to look back, however the wife did and turned into a pillar of salt.
    By the time Lot reached Zoar, Sodom and Gomorrah has been destroyed by burning sulfur.
  </p>
  <p>
    Lot and his 2 daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains. The older daughter was worried that there will be no men to give them children.
    So both of them slept with their father and the older daughter gave birth to Moab which will be the father of Moabites and
    the younger daughter gave birth to Ben-Ammi which will be the father of Ammonites.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1.  Why did Lot bow down with his face to the ground to the two angels, and insisted so strongly that they would lodge in his house rather than stay in the night square? 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    He knew that they're Holy Spirits. Lot was Abraham's helper, so he knew what the presence of God is like. 
    He insisted because Sodom is a very sinful and dangerous place. They might get robbed or raped.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2.  Why didn’t the men of Sodom show the same reverence to the angles as Lot showed? (Matthew 5:8)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    They're blinded by sin. When you're blinded by sin, you won't be able to recognize or feel the presence of the Holy Spirit.
    Same goes for our daily life. When we're blinded by worldly things and keep chasing after them, we won't be able to feel God's
    presence.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3.  What criteria might we use to assess whether a disaster has any element of God's judgment within it?

  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4. Why did the angels have to take hold of Lot's hand? (verse 16)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Lot did not want to live his belongings in Sodom and trust in the Angels. Lot lived near the gateway shows that he is a very
    influencial man at that time.
  </div>

  <div class="question">

    <ul>
      <li>Lot's</li>
      <li>Lot’s wife </li>
      <li>Lot’s sons in law</li> 
      <li>Lot daughters.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <p>Lot is corrupted, sick (because he offered his two daughters to strangers), no respect for women and does not stand firm in what he believe.</p>
    <p>Lot's wife isn't obedient. The angels clearly told her not to look back and she did.</p>
    <p>Lot's sons in law in law did not respect him and laughed at him instead</p>
    <p>Lot's daughter, like their father is sick. They would resort to incest just to have children.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    6. "Looking back" may be either a positive or a negative reaction.  How would you distinguish between the two? (verse 17, verse 26). Why did Jesus say "Remember Lot's wife"? (Luke 17:32) 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
