    Dear Father,
  </p>
  <p>
    I cannot explain how much I love you. You are my heavenly father and I want to be close to you.
    Thank you for always being there for me no matter what for you are a forgiving God and full of grace.
    Thank you because you always lead me to the right path no matter how bad my decision may be.
    Thank you for giving me advice always.
    And that is why I love you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for the prophetic words you gave today. Writing songs is my passion and music is my passion.
    I'm glad that you've approve what I'm doing. Now I can go on with a peace of heart.
    I won't say thank you for you are my father and the only words I'll say is I love you.
  </p>
