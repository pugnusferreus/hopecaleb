    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    Abraham and his family moved to the region of Negev and lived between Kadesh and Shur. 
    They stayed in Gerar for a while. In Gerar, Abraham introduces Sarah as his sister.
    King Abimelek heard about this and asked his men to take her.
  </p>
  <p>
    That night, God appeared in Abimelek's dream and told him "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.".
    Abimelek told God that he had not gone near her so he said "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation? Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,`
    and didn't she also say, `He is my brother`? I have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands".
    Then God said to him "Yes, I know you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her. 
    Now return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. 
    But if you do not return her, you may be sure that you and all who belong to you will die."
  </p>
  <p>
    Next day, Abimelek told his officials and they were all affraid. 
    Then Abimelek told asked Abraham 
    "What have you done to us? How have I wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done. What was your reason for doing this?".
    Then Abraham told Abimelek that Gerar probably isn't affraid of God and will probably kill him if he tells the truth.
    Abraham also tried to twist his words by saying that Sarah really is his sister in the sense that she is the daughter of his step mother.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Abimelek gave Abraham cattle, sheep, slaves and told Abraham that he can live anywhere in the land of Gerar.
    Then he gave Sarah a thousand shekels of silver. This is to cover the offense against her.
    Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelek, his wife and his female slaves so that they can give birth again.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1. Why did Abraham leave from where he is currently in Mamre (Genesis 12:9-10) to the land of the Negev? (Prov 16:25)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    The place he was currently in was too close to Sodom and it was raining sulfur at that time. 
    For the safety of his family, again, he did not seek God's advice and moved on to another place.
