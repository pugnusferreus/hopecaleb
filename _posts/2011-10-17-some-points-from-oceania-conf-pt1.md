    Found my Hope Oceania 2011 notebook and found some notes in it. Would love to share it with whoever is reading this :)
    Hopefully, this will refresh our minds on what happened during the Ocenia Conference 2011.

    This conference holds a special place in my heart.<br/>
    It is this conference where where I reached out my hands to God and asked for his power.<br/>
    It is this conference where I started speaking in tongue.<br/>
    It is this conference that God sparked a fire in my heart for me to join the Praise and Worship team.

    Questions to ponder:
  </h2>
  <h2>
    What are some key aspects of teaching that could help us to better engage with God and bring heaven down on earth?
  </h2>
  <h2>
    What is "Above the Line" about and why did this fresh perspective evolve? What was gained as a result?
  </h2>
  <ul>
    <li>God never contradicts his words but contradicts our understanding of it.</li>
    <li>What do I have to do to go to heaven? Lead a Christian life.</li>
    <li>Heaven invades earth through me.</li>
    <li>Jesus came as a mesiah to go against the enemy of mankind, the devil.</li>
    <li>We are here to multiply bread and fish, to open blind eyes and to save. In John 14:12, "Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father." and John 2:6-12</li>
    <li>Christian life is about spreading the Kingdom of God through yourself.</li>
    <li>Rules doesn't change our behaviour. Does the Victorian rules and regulation changes your behaviour?</li>
    <li>If we don't believe in what Jesus did will save us, our behaviour won't change</li>
    <li>Paul's letter starts with something theological and ends with the way on how we should live.</li>
    <li>Right believing is right living</li>
    <li>Abrahamic words is about your pedigree Genesis 12:10-20</li>
    <li>Mosaic covenant. Because you behave and perform the right things (Exodus 24:3-10). If we were to follow the Mosaic covenant, we're living under the covenant of law rather than grace (old testament)</li>
    <li>Don't change your theology base on your own experience. Don't get discourage when your prayer doesn't heal.</li>
    <li>You are holy and blameless</li>
    <li>Behaviour is an echo to what you believe</li>
    <li>God is not interested in what is wrong but what is missing</li>
    <li>To be a devoted Christian is not about the performance, but believing right</li>
  </ul>
