    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    God never forgets his promise. Sarah gave birth to Isaac.
    When Isaac was 8 days old, Abraham circumcised him as God commanded him.
    Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Abraham threw a great feast. Apparently, the son of Hagar was mocking it and Sarah told Abraham
    to get rid of Hagar and her son for they will never share the inheritence with Isaac.
    Abraham was stressed about this matter because it concerned his son.
    God told Abraham not to be distressed and listen to Sarah. God told Abraham that Hagar's son will be the father of a nation for he is the son of Abraham's.
  </p>
  <p>
    The next day, Abraham sent them off and they wandered off into the Desert of Beersheba.
    When Hagar ran out of food and water she put the boy under one of the bushes and then she went off to bow down for she cannot watch the boy die.
    God heard the boy crying and the angel of God asked Hagar what is wrong? The Angel told Hagar to lift the boy up by his hand for God will make him into a great nation.
    Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She then filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
    The boy grew up, lived in the dessert and became an archer. While he was living in the Desert of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from Egypt.
  </p>
  <p>
    Abimelek and Phicol the commander of his forces told Abraham that God is with him in everything he does.
    Then he asked Abraham to swear to him that he will not deceive him, his children or to his descendants.
    Abraham swore but complained that Abimelek's servants seized a water well that belonged to Abraham.
    Abimelek did not know about this matter.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, Abraham brought sheep and cattle to Abimelek as treaty. By accepting the gifts, Abimelek agrees that the well was dug by Abraham's hands.
    The place where the two men made the oath were called Beersheba.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1. What does the account(verse 1-8) say about the way God fulfils His covenant promises?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God always fulfil his promises no matter what. It's not about what we do but the power of the Holy Spirit.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2. Why do you think the first few verses were emphasising that the child Isaac was given more for Sarah's benefit rather than Abraham's benefit?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">

  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3. The name Isaac means "he laughs." What is Sarah's laughter like now compared to her laughter in 18:12-15 and Abraham's laughter in 17:17?
    What does this tell you about God's sense of humour?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Her laugh is the laugh of joy. Pure genuine happiness. Before that, her laughter was sarcastic/mocking laugh.
    She laughed that way previously because she had doubt. I believe that everyone one of us had this same feeling as well.
    We should always have faith in the power of the Holy Spirit.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4. Why did Sarah demand that Hagar and Ishmael leave Abraham's household? Do you think this was reasonable of her?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Jealous and fear. She doesn't want Hagar and Ishmael to share Isaac's inheritence too.
    It is not reasonable of her for she shares the same amount of blame with Abraham.
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    5. Do you think that the sending away of Ishmael was "right things sometimes happen for the wrong reasons"? (Genesis 25:17-18)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    6. How did God help and encourage Hagar in her hour of crisis (verse 15-21)?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God told Hagar that Ishmael will grow up to be father of nations as well. Then God made a well of water infront of them
    so that Hagar and Ishmael will live on.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    7. What do we learn about God's nature and character in His care for Hagar and Ishmael (verse 12-21)?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God is very caring and full of grace. Eventhough they're not the choosen one, God cared for them as well.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    8. How did Abimelek and Abraham resolve the problems they had with each other? (Romans 12:18, Hebrews 12:14).
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Abimelek told Abraham not to deceive and lie to him again. The reason why Abimelek approached Abraham first is because
    he too, believes in the same mighty God.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    9.  What do you think is the significance of verse 33?
  </div>
