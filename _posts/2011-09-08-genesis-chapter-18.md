    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
   When Abraham was resting at the entrance of hist tent, 3 men (The Lord) appeared near the great trees of Mamre.
   He instantly knew that the three men was God and said to them "If I have found favor in your eyes, my lord, do not pass your servant by. Let a little water be brought, and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree. Let me get you something to eat, so you can be refreshed and then go on your way—now that you have come to your servant."
  </p>
  <p>
    Abraham then ordered Sarah to prepare a huge feast for the Lord. Then one of the men told Abraham that Sarah will have a son next year.
    Sarah secretly listened to the conversation between Abraham and The Lord.
    Since Sarah and Abraham is old and already past the age of childbearing, Sarah laughed to herself.
    Then The Lord said to Abraham "Why did Sarah laugh?".
    Sarah then was afraid and became defensive and said "I did not laugh" and he said "Yes, you did laugh".
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the three men got up and head towards Sodom. The Lord said "The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me. If not, I will know.".
    Then Abraham asked The Lord if he will sweep away the city along with the righteous people (if there is any).
    Then the Lord told Abraham that he will not sweep away the city if there are righteous people in Sodom.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1.  Have you ever wondered what it means to "walk by faith"? Do you see that walk of faith in Abraham’s life and in your life? (2 Cor 5:7, John 20:25)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    &nbsp;
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2. Why did Abraham bowed low to the ground to the three men and begged them to stay with his hospitality?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Abraham knows that the three men is Holy and is The Lord. Since he knew that they're Holy,
    he humbles himself and respect them. He showed hospitality by preparing meal for them.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3.  Why did Sarah laugh within herself (not out loud but in silent)? (Ps 139:1-2, 4; Heb 4:13; 1 John 3:20)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    She laughed because The Lord told Abraham that Sarah will have a son next year and she has passed her child bearing age.
    She did not laugh out loud because she respected them and also was afraid which leads her to lie.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4. Why did the Lord told Sarah "Is there anything too hard for the Lord"? Do you think there’s anything in your life that’s too hard for God to change?

    That is because she doesn't have faith in God.
