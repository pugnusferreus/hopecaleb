    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    Abram was afraid and was troubled by a few things. 
    Basically God assured him that he will protect him by saying <b>"Do not fear, Abram, I am a shield to you; your reward shall be very great."</b>.
    On verse 6, Abram is considered righteous because he believed in God.
    This applies to our daily life. If we believe in Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit will come to us and we will be righteous as well.
    However, Abram doubt God's promise by asking for signs.
  </p>

  <p>
    God then asked Abram to bring him a heifer, a goat and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon.
    Abram cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other except for the birds.
    To prevent the birds of prey from getting the carcasses, Abram tried to drive them away.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the day, Abram was tired and he fell asleep. God walked pass the animals that was cut in to two which is a sign of covenant back in the days. He then told Abram that his descendants will be enslaved and mistreated for 400 years. God also assured that He will punish those who
    mistread the descendants of Abram.
