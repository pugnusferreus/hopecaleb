    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    Even after 10 years since God's promise to Abram, Sarai wasn't pregnant at all.
    She asked Abram to sleep with her Egyptian slave, Hagar and Abram agreed.
    When Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to despise Sarai.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because of this, Sarai blamed Abram for her suffering. 
    Abram on the other hand tried to avoid responsibility by telling Sarai that Hagar is her slave and she 
    should do what she thinks best. Sarai mistreated Hagar and Hagar ran away.
  </p>
  <p>
    The angel of the Lord found Hagar near a spring in the desert. The angel asked Hagar what is wrong and she explained
    everything to the angel. The angel asked Hagar to return home. She did what the angel adviced her to do
    and gave birth to Ishmael.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1.  How long has it been since the Lord has renewed His promise to Abram that he would have a son?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    10 years
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2. What was Sarai’s rationale?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    She claims that The Lord has kept her from having children. 
    From this, we know that Sarai is very impatient and did not wait for God's signal.
    The culture back then also allows a man to consumate with another woman if the wife is unable to bear children.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3. Would you consider yourself to be a patient person? Describe the things that you are patient with and the things that you’re not patient with.
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    This is an open question.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4. Genesis 16:2 said that “Abram agreed to what Sarai said”. Why did he agree? Would you have done the same thing? 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    &nbsp;
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    5. What were the consequences that occurred to Sarai, and to the household as a result to her suggestions? What was Sarai’s response to Abram in verse 5? 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    When Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to despise Sarai. The entire household became a mess.
    Because of this, Sarai tried to push the blame to Abram.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    6. Why do you think Abram responded like the way he did in verse 6?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    Abram wanted to avoid any responsibility.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    7. Abram made at least four mistakes in this chapter. What were they? 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <ul>
      <li>Listened to Sarai</li>
      <li>Eventhough God promised Abram will have a son, he succumbed to temptation</li>
      <li>He didn't talk to God about it</li>
      <li>
        Even if he thinks that maybe a prophecy from God to Sarai, he did not test the prophecy. 
        God says that we must be faithful to our partners.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    8. Would it not have been convenient if the Lord had just allowed Hagar to go? 
    Hagar could have made a new life for herself and her child Abram and Sarai could have gotten on with their lives but the Lord didn’t just let her 
    go: He went after her and brought her back. Why? 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <ul>
      <li>So that Hagar and Ishmael will be protected under Abram</li>
      <li>Psalm 68:5 says "A father to the fatherless, a defender of widows, is God in his holy dwelling."</li>
      <li>To make Abram into a more responsible man</li>
      <li>The Lord knows that running away from your problem won't solve anything</li>
      <li>You should always treat your master(God) right no matter what. God is always nice to us anyways</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
    <div class="question">
    9. What do you think are some of the take home principles we can learn from this chapter?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    <ul>
      <li>Genesis 16:13 God is a God that sees us and hears us</li>
      <li>Take responsibility</li>
      <li>You have to beware of temptations (be wise)</li>
      <li>Consult God before jumping into any decision</li>
      <li>Be patient</li>
    </ul>
