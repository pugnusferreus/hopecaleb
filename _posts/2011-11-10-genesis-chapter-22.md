    Summary
  </h2>
  <p>
    God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac as a burnt offering on a mountain.
    The next morning, Abraham loaded his donkey, and took two of his servants and Isaac.
    Abraham asked two of his servants to stay put on the foot of the mountain while he and Isaac continue their journey to the top of the mountain.    
  </p>
  <p>
    Isaac asked Abraham where is the sacrifice. Abraham told Isaac that God will provide.
    When they reach the place, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. 
    He then bound Isaac and put him on the altar.
  </p>
  <p>
    When Abraham was about to slay his son, the angel of the LORD (who was Jesus at that time) called out to him.
    The angel told him not to kill Isaac, and the angel acknowledge that Abraham fear God.
    Then Abraham saw a ram was caught by it's horns. Abraham then use it as an offering.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then the angel bless Abraham and his descendants. Do note that Genesis 22 is quite important in the sense that it's a shadow
    of things to come.

    Questions
  </h2>
  <div class="question">
    1.  In verse 2 God said "Take your son, your only son...". Is this statement correct?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">

  </div>
  <div class="question">
    2.  What do you think are the differences between God's purpose in testing 
    a person and Satan’s purpose in testing a person? (James 2:22, Proverbs 17:3, James 1:2-4, 1 Peter 1:6-7)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God tests, Satan temps. Sometimes it's hard to know if the voice you're hearing is from God or not. God's words are always aligned with the Bible.
    When we grow as a Christian, we'll be tested by God. This is to test your worthiness. The test can act as a refiner's fire as well.
    We should always experience God's tests with joy.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    3.  How can a God of wisdom, mercy, justice, and love command Abraham to offer up his only son as a sacrifice? (James 1:13, 1 John 1:5). Infant 
    sacrifice was practiced by the Canaanites, but it was condemned by God (Leviticus 18:21; Deuteronomy 12:31). 
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    God wants to see where he stands in Abraham's heart. Same goes to our daily life. We should put God as our main priority and 
    we should not worship or be obsessed with worldy things such as money or carreer.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    4.  How come Abraham interceded with God for Sodom, but not for his son Isaac?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
  </div>

  <div class="question">
    5. What do you think are some of the challenges to Abraham to obey God faithfully in this instance?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    The thought of having to sacrifice his son, Abraham had to go through alot of emotions at that time.
    He had to leave the house early so that he will not wake Sarah up as she'll surely oppose his actions.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    6. When Abraham answered Isaac's question in 22:8, did he utter the words God will provide himself a lamb prophetically or was Abraham just trying to 
    put Isaac’s mind at ease?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    It is abit of both. Eventhough Abraham loves his son very much, he is willing to submit everything to God
    and have faith in him. He needs to put Isaac's mind at ease so that Isaac won't worry too much.
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    7. In verse 12, why do you think God said "...Now I know that you fear God... " rather than "trust" or "obey"? (Hebrews 11:17-19)
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
  </div>
  <div class="question">
    8.  Why do you think God repeated His promised blessing to Abraham in 22:17, 18?
  </div>
  <div class="answer">
    This is because Abraham has faith and is obedient to God. And with faith and obedience, comes blessings ( through Christ )
