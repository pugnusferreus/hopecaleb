    <p>Welcome to the Hope Church's Caleb 3 site.</p>
    <p>
      Why a website? Why can't we just form a Facebook group?
      We believe that whatever comes out from our relationship with God and how God's grace has changed our lives,
      we should put it down in some form of a scripture. 
      Did the 12 apostles listen to Jesus and forget about it the following week? No, they wrote it down and that's
      where most of the scriptures from the New Testament comes from.

    <p>
      From the book of Matthew 28:18 - 20:
    </p>
    <p>
      18 Then Jesus came to them and said, <b>"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</b> 19 <b>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </b>20 <b>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."</b>
